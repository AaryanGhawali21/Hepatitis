# Hepatitis
The project focuses on applying data mining classification techniques—Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and J48 Decision Tree—on the HCV dataset to predict patient outcomes (LIVE or DIE). By analyzing biochemical and medical attributes, the goal is to support early detection and improve decision-making in hepatitis care.
